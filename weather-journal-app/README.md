# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

### Building
To get the project up and running I followed these steps:

1. Setting up project environment, making sure have Node and packages installed, and included in server.js file.
2. Added POST and GET routes to ensure correct retrieval of data from the server.
3. Acquired API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website.
4. Created async functions to fetch weather data and store it on my local server. 
5. Set up a function that updated UI dynamically.
